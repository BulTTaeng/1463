![course_button](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/1463/blob/main/1463_pro.JPG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

First time, I think about up-bottom approach. After that I realized that it is unefficient because there are many overlapping calculation.
So I dicided to use bottom-up approach.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
